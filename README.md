### discourse-directoryopus

This is a custom Discoure plugin specific to the Directory Opus forum.

It's not something anyone would find useful to install themselves, but you may find
the source code useful if you're trying to do something. Maybe I'll link people to
it if a technique used in the code can help answer a question they have on writing
their own plugins.
